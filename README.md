Here's the explanation for my code :)

Component Initialization:

UserInput is a functional component that initializes its state using the useState hook. It defines two pieces of state:
formData: An object that stores the user's input for the day (DD), month (MM), and year (YYYY) of birth.
isValid: A boolean that determines whether the user's input is valid or not.
handleSubmit Function:

This function is called when the user submits the form.
It parses the user's input into numeric values and creates a Date object for the birthdate.
It checks if the birthdate is valid by ensuring that the input is numeric and corresponds to a valid date.
If the input is valid, it calculates the age in years, months, and days and updates the state accordingly.
If the input is invalid, it sets isValid to false.
onChangeValue Function:

This function is called when the user changes the input values (DD, MM, or YYYY).
It extracts the name and value from the input element and parses value into a numeric value.
If the value is numeric, it updates the corresponding field in the formData state.
Rendering the Form:

The component renders a form with three input fields for day, month, and year of birth. Each input field is associated with its corresponding label (DD, MM, YYYY).
If the input is invalid, an error message is displayed below the input field.
Rendering the Result:

Below the form, the component displays the calculated age in years, months, and days. If the input is invalid, it displays "--" in place of the age values.
Button:

A button with a purple background and an icon is displayed. It triggers the handleSubmit function when clicked.
CSS Classes and Styling:

The code includes CSS classes and styles for various elements to control their appearance and layout. It also uses conditional styling to change text colors based on whether the input is valid or not.
In summary, this component allows users to input their birthdate, calculates their age, and displays the result. It provides feedback to users about the validity of their input and adjusts the display accordingly.
